# NcFTPd

NcFTPd is a high-performance File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server software solution for UNIX systems, designed especially for high-traffic sites and internet service providers. It is also popular among students, home users, educational sites, and businesses. NcFTPd has been providing fast, flexible, secure, and commercially supported FTP service since 1996!

The reason is simple -- you can service more remote users at a time, and therefore move more data out the door. Instead of upgrading your hardware, upgrade your software by using NcFTPd. It is certainly cheaper to install NcFTPd than it is to buy more workstations whose sole purpose is to act as additional FTP servers.

There are also security benefits you can't find anywhere else. Since NcFTPd was designed from day one with security in mind, it has gained a reputation among administrators as a very secure product. NcFTPd is periodically re-audited to reduce the probability that a buffer overflow, race condition, denial-of-service, or other security problem exists.

NcFTPd is very configurable, including powerful support for virtual hosts and virtual users, but is still a breeze to install.
